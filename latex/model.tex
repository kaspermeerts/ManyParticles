\subsection{Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution}

The well-known \textbf{Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution} describes the molecular 
speed for a monoatomic classical ideal gas in thermodynamic equilibrium.

$$
f(v)\dif v = \left( \frac{\beta m}{2 \pi} \right)^{3/2} 4 \pi v^2 e^{-\beta 
\frac{mv^2}{2}} \dif v
$$
where $\beta$ is given by
\begin{math}
\beta \equiv \frac{1}{k_BT}
\end{math}
, $T$ is the temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $m$ is the 
molecular mass of the gas.

In this section, we derive a similar expression for a two-dimensional gas.
Consider a gas consisting of a single molecule of mass $m$ in a container in 
contact with a heat bath of temperature $T$. The probability of the particle 
being in a state with energy $E$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution.
$$
P(E) \dif E \propto e^{-\beta E}\dif E
$$
Since the energy of particle is only a function of the velocity $\vec{v}$, $E = 
\frac{mv^2}{2}$, we can deduce
$$
P(\vec v)\dif{\vec v} \propto e^{- \beta \frac{m |\vec v|^2}{2}}\dif\vec v
$$
But we're interested in the speed distribution, not the velocity distribution.  
For this, we use a substitution to polar coordinates
$$
\dif \vec{v} = \dif v_x\dif v_y = v\dif v\dif \theta
$$
where $v=|\vec{v}|$ is the speed. So
$$
f(v)\dif v\dif \theta \propto ve^{- \beta \frac{mv^2}{2}} \dif v\dif \theta
$$
Since the distribution is independent of the parameter $\theta$, we can 
integrate over it and remove it from the equation.
$$
f(v)\dif v\propto ve^{- \beta \frac{mv^2}{2}} \dif v
$$
After normalisation we find the \textbf{Rayleigh distribution}
$$
f(v)\dif v=\beta m ve^{-\beta \frac{mv^2}{2}} \dif v
$$

\subsection{Elastic collision}

The most basic interaction that needs to be modeled in a many particle system 
is the elastic collision between hard spheres or disks. Consider two particles 
denoted by subscripts 1 and 2. Let $m_i$ be the masses, $v_c$ be the the 
velocity of the center of mass (COM) frame, $v_i$ the velocities before the 
collision, $v'_i$ the velocities before collision in the COM frame, $w_i$ the 
velocities after the collision and $w'_i$ the velocities after collision in the 
COM frame. We assume the speed of both bodies is non-relativistic.

The one-dimensional results are well known
$$
v_c = \frac{m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2}
$$
$$
v_1 = \exp{c}
$$
