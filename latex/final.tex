\section{Final thoughts}

When simulating a many-particle system, considerable performance improvements 
can be achieved using the technique of space partitioning. We have shown that 
the naive quadratic complexity can be reduced to linear complexity. This allows 
one to simulate various physical systems such as a gasses and solids 
efficiently without losing physical correctness, as was shown for the case of 
Brownian motion and the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution.  Additional 
phenomena suitable for implementation were suggested for further studies, such 
as heat conduction and capacity, the Van der Waals correction and a simple 
classical model of adsorption.
