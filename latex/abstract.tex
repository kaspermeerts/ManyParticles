In many research areas, one has the need to simulate a many-particle system.  
Short-range interactions are of considerable interest, for example when the 
particles represent atoms or molecules. The amount of pairs of particles that 
possibly need to be checked is of the order of $O(n^2)$. But the dynamics of a 
particle depend only on its close neighbours. Thus we implement a technique 
based on \emph{spatial partitioning} where the world is divided in a fixed 
amount of partitions and particles only interact with other particles in nearby 
partitions. Simulations show that the complexity is reduced to $O(n)$, a 
dramatic improvement. A few phenomena are simulated and studied, e.g. the 
Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution and Brownian motion.
