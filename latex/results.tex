\section{Results}
\subsection{Physical results}

To validate the correctness of the software, we have tested some important 
physical phenomena that are described by statistical mechanics. We studied the 
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and Brownian motion. Other interesting phenomena 
include adsorption models, the Van der Waals corrections to the ideal gas law, 
diffusion, heat conduction, phase transitions, thin film phenomena, etc...

\subsubsection{Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution}
The Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution describes the probability density of 
the speed of a gas particle. The necessary temperature parameter was calculated 
from our simulation using the equipartition theorem.
$$
E_{\textrm{avg, kin}} = \left< \frac{mv^2}{2} \right> = \frac{3k_BT}{2}
$$
With $m$ the mass of each particle and $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant. Both were 
set to unity in our simulation. Thus
$$
T = \frac{\left< v^2 \right>}{3}
$$
The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution follows
$$
f(v)\dif v = \left( \frac{\beta m}{2 \pi} \right)^{3/2} 4 \pi v^2
\exp\left( -\beta \frac{mv^2}{2}\right) \dif v =
\sqrt{ \frac{2}{\pi T^3} } v^2 \exp \left(-\frac{v^2}{2T}\right) \dif v
$$

The resulting simulated distribution is shown in figure \ref{maxwell} together 
with the theoretical result. The results are clearly in perfect agreement with 
the predicted result.

theoretical distribution for a temperature of 1/9}

\subsubsection{Brownian motion}
With a small change to the software, a single massive, huge particle was 
introduced in the system. Because of its relative size, space partitioning 
could not be used for this new particle and each smaller particle had to be 
checked for interactions with the huge particle separately. This had a 
negligible effect on performance.

dot. (worldsize $320 \times 320 \times 320$, 10000 particles of radius 0.5, 
radius of large particle: 10, mass: 1)}

The trajectory of the particle was saved and plotted in figure \ref{brown}.  
Brownian motion is discernible in the path.

\subsubsection{Heat conduction}

Heat conduction is another phenomenon that can be studied. No results are shown 
in this article but we propose a method how one can implement this using the 
software. This simulation is based on heat conduction by electrons in a metal.

We propose to give two opposite walls a different temperature.  When a particle 
collides with a wall, it gets a random mixture of its own momentum and the 
momentum it would have had if it had the same temperature as the wall.  
Throughout the system, a regular grid of stationary particles is set up. These 
particles can exchange kinetic energy with the moving particles after a 
collision. The stationary particle stores its kinetic energy in a vibration 
mode. This gives an idea of the temperature distribution of the system.
